# Design Guide

- Minimalistic aesthetic focused on text with black content on white background
- Typography hierarchy uses font size, weight variations, and text lightness with browser default fonts
- Black and white only - no other colors for text, links, or interface elements
- Layout uses flexbox and CSS grid where necessary with minimal custom styling
- Headings are emphasized by size and bold text weight
